## Course Structure

- Language: PHP
- Format: One design pattern per laboratory assignment
- Objective: Master the implementation and practical application of design patterns through structured exercises

## Lab 1: Singleton Pattern
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Singleton design pattern** using a simple file storage management system.
The system allows a user to connect to one of several storage options, such as:

- Local disk storage
- Amazon S3 storage

The **StorageManager** class is implemented as a **Singleton**, ensuring that only one instance of the storage manager exists in the application.
